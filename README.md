# Stock-Price-Prediction
This program helps to accurately predict the closing stock price of any given stock till the date specified using LSTM networks. 
 LSTM networks are a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN)â€”a neural network architecture used for modeling sequential data and often applied to natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The advantage of LSTMs is that they retain information for long periods of time, allowing for important information learned early in the sequence to have a larger impact on model decisions made at the end of the sequence.
